								<p>This project is an attempt to decipher the ancient Indus Valley script by comparing it with modern Tamil (a Dravidian language).
									<b>Our strategy is to:</b>
									Convert Tamil script from <b>syllabic</b> to <b>logosyllabic</b> by converting <b>morphemes</b> to signs.
									Perform a statistical analysis to compare the converted script with the Indus script.
								</p>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/translate.PNG" alt="" /></span>
								<p>
									<b>Tamil</b> - A Dravidian language
									<b>Syllabic script</b> - A writing system whose characters represent syllables.
									<b>Logosyllabic script</b> - A writing systems whose characters represent syllables, words and morphemes.
									<b>Morpheme</b> - The smallest part of a word that changes its meaning. Ex- 'ing' in 'following'
	
									The Indus Valley or Harappan civilization is India's oldest civilization spanning from 5500 BCE to 1300 BCE. However, their writing system is still undeciphered. The obstacles to deciphering the script have included:

									- The exact uses of the artifacts are mostly unknown.
									- The root language of the script is unknown.
									- The texts are short (mean = 4.5 signs).
									- Lack of bilingual inscription/tablet, E.g. Rosetta stone which recorded two Egyptian scripts and ancient Greek
									- The complete corpus of the text was not widely available.

									Since 2013, however, there have been breakthroughs in the field of population genetics that have given clues about the root language of the script. The 2013 paper ‘South Asia: Dravidian Linguistic History’ authored by Professor Franklin C. Southworth and Dr David W. McAlpin reconstructed Proto Dravidian (one of the two main Indian language families) vocabulary and found similarities with Proto Elamite vocabulary (the language of the Zagros region).
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/DNA-Genetics.gif" alt="" /></span>
									Through their archeological and linguistic research, they were able to conclude that the Harappan language is most likely <b>Proto Dravidian</b> (with influences from Proto Elamite). Furthermore, it was concluded that this language has evolved into the major modern Dravidian languages (Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, etc). We are testing the <b>hypothesis</b> that Proto Dravidian is the language of the Harappans by comparing <b>modern Tamil</b> with the <b>Harappan script</b>.

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/conversion.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>
									The first step to compare the Indus script with Tamil is to convert Tamil from a <b>syllabic</b> to a <b>logosyllabic script</b>.
									Similar to the Indus script, we modelled the structure of the syllables after <b>cuneiform</b> and created syllables of the forms <b>CV</b>, <b>VC</b>, <b>V</b> and <b>C</b> (Where 'C' is consonant and 'V' is vowel).
								<div>
									<img src="images/cuneiform.gif" alt="" style="height: 300px;"/>
									<img src="images/cuneiform.jpg" alt="" style="width: 50%; height: 300px;"/>
								</div>			
									<br>
									We used the labelled Tamil database provided by the Institute of Formal and Applied Linguistics (UFAL) <a href = "https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/~ramasamy/tamiltb/0.1/introduction.html#1.2.Data">See Tagged Dataset</a>.
									The dataset consists of Tamil news articles tagged by part of speech (POS). 
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/conllfile.png" alt="" /></span>
									
									Some of the morphemes including clitics and postpositions were already separated. However, the dataset does not separate noun and verb morphemes. 
									Tamil word morphology is exclusive to nouns and verbs. We split the database into morphemes, clitics, and lemmas and formulated tables stored in our PostgresSQL server. 
									
									We converted the lemmas and morphemes (including noun and verb morphemes as well as clitics, determiners, etc) into <b>logograms</b> (sign represents a word or morpheme) 
									by giving each of them their unique sign identifier.

									</a>
								</div>
								<p>
									<h2>Possible Plural Marker</h2>
									The most frequent sign in the Tamil script is the plural marker <b>‘கள்’ (kal)</b> or <b>sign 4012</b>. On analyzing the most frequent Indus signs, one sign had a very similar positional distribution: <b>sign 220</b>.
								</p>	
								<div>
									<iframe width="100%" height="894px" src="https://public.tableau.com/views/PluralMarker/Dashboard1?:showVizHome=no&:embed=true">
									</iframe>
								</div>
								<p>
									<b>Sign 220</b> is a fish sign. Fish Signs are often associated with numerals. They also mostly occur in the medial context. It can be found in the initial, medial as well as terminal positions.
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/terminal.png" alt="" /></span>
									This behaviour was previously attributed to polyvalence but there is a possibility that the range is due to its function as plural marker. An analysis of sign groupings also shows that <b>sign 220</b> occurs with multiple other signs (not just numerals). This further strengthens the case that it is the plural marker.
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/pluraltable.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								</p>
								<h2>Deep Neural Network to Predict Syllables</h2>
								<p>
									We calculated the probability distribution of the normalized sign positions and used them as features in a deep neural network.
									
									This was done to see if it is possible to predict if a sign is a syllable based on the positional distribution alone. It was previously hypothesized that a uniform frequency for all positions is a good indicator of a syllabic sign, since syllables are used everywhere in texts without syntactic restriction.
									
									The result had a poor F1 score of 42% for predicting syllables. This shows that positional distribution alone is insufficient to predict syllables. This can be attributed to two reasons:
									<ol>
										<li>Sentences in the database are long and consist of multiple nouns followed by a verb. Tamil has a subject-object-verb syntax. This results in some noun lemmas and clitics having a uniform sign distribution similar to what is expected for syllables. The Indus artifacts have shorter sentences (suggests fewer nouns) so this problem may not exist when evaluating the Indus script.
										</li>
										<b>FIX</b>:
										<br>Perform the analysis on shorter sentences (simple Subject-object-Verb construction) and see if the machine learning precision/recall score increases.
										<br>
										<br>

											</iframe>
										</div>
										<br>
										<li>Positional distribution alone is insufficient and there are missing variables. 
										</li>
										<b>FIX</b>:
										<br>Include sign connectivities into the features table (E.g. include number of signs grouped with the sign in question) and see if that increases the score.
									</ol>
								</p>
								<p>
									<h2>Statistical Tools:</h2>
									<h3>Modified Power Law</h3>
									We initially used the Modified Power Law to test if the script is logosyllabic. On calculating the modified power law for the converted Tamil script, the resulting value was G = -1.13 similar to Old Assyrian Cuneiform. This classifies the script as <b>logosyllabic</b>.

									</iframe>
								</div>
								<p>
									<h3>Histograms</h3>
									We then calculated <b>positional histograms</b> to identify positional frequencies for each Tamil sign. Each bar represents where in a word, the sign is more frequently seen. 
									Keep in mind Tamil reads from left to right and Indus script reads from right to left. To see these some examples, see the dropdowns below showcasing Tamil and Indus script histograms. These histograms can be used to compare which Tamil and Indus valley signs have similar position frequency distributions.

									<h3>Segmentation Trees</h3>
									Another analysis tool we used were <b>segmentation trees</b>. We identified key sign pairs and calculated their connectivities. Using this, we created our segmentation trees. The higher 
									the segmentation tree, the higher the connectivity between the sign pair. We can then compare this to Indus sign groups. The goal is to identify morphemes with similar distributions in both scripts.

									</div>
								<p>
									For this project, we had to manually identify and segment the morphemes. Going forward, we can automate this process. Automating it requires a tagged dataset which we did not have at the beginning of the project, hence the manual extraction.
									
									We programmed a SVM algorithm to automatically perform morpheme extraction on Tamil. We referenced the paper 'Morpheme Extraction and Lemmatization for Tamil using Machine Learning' which used SVM to perform Tamil morpheme segmentation resulting in a high F score. Morpheme extraction is an essential part of morphological analysis. 

									After preprocessing, the words in our dataset and SQL tables were used for our SVM. We obtained the form, lemma, part of speech identifier, and identified the morphemes within each word. After consulting the paper 'Morpheme Extraction and Lemmatization for Tamil using Machine Learning’, we identified the current letter of the word, prefix, vowel/consonant, noun, and verb as vital features for the algorithm.

									We programmed to manually fill the features_df with the appropriate features:
									<ul>
										<li>Identified if the current letter of the word was a vowel (1) or consonant (0)</li>
										<li>Noted if the word was a noun indicated by a 1 and a verb represented by a 1 in their columns</li>
										<li>Extracted the letters before the current letter to fill the prefix column</li>
										<li>Added programming to identify the morpheme boundaries in each word as our output label for the model</li>
									</ul>
									
									Before implementing the model, Label Encoding was used on the letters column and prefix columns to allow for numerical values only. Features selected were the <b>index</b>, <b>vowel/consonant</b>, <b>noun</b>, <b>verb</b>, <b>letter_label_encoded</b>, and <b>prefix_label_encoded</b>. A Standard Scaler was applied to avoid numerical overflow while running the model. The output label for our model was defined as <b>morpheme boundary</b>.
									
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/segmentmorpheme.gif" alt="" /></span>
									
									We used a 75% training and 25% testing data split with a rbf kernel with a gamma of 0.8 to achieve an <b>accuracy of 76%</b>.
