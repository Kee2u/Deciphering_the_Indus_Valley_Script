## Converting Tamil from a Syllabic to a logosyllabic script

The Converted Tamil Folder consists of the following files:

<strong>morphemes_labelled</strong> - each noun and verb morpheme has been given its own identifier. </break></break>
<strong>letters_labelled</strong> - Letters remaining after converted syllables to CV and VC are in this file.
<strong>VC_syllables_labelled</strong> - has vowel-consonant syllables that have been given their own identifiers.
<strong>CV_syllables_labelled</strong> - has consonant-vowel syllables that have been given their own identifiers.
<strong>clitics_and_postpositions_labelled</strong> - has clitics, postpositions, determiners etc and their identifiers.
<strong>logo_syllabic_tamil_sentences</strong> - Logosyllabic Tamil Sentences
<strong>lemmas_labelled</strong> - Lemmas of Verbs, Adjectives, Numerals, Adverbs, Nouns and Pronouns and their identifiers. Proper nouns were left as syllables instead of converted into logograms.

### Notes:

I used the labelled Tamil database provided by the Institute of Formal and Applied Linguistics (UFAL) available here: https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/~ramasamy/tamiltb/0.1/introduction.html#1.2.Data [1]

The dataset consists of Tamil news articles tagged by part of speech. Some of the morphemes including clitics and postpositions have been separated already. However, the dataset does not separate noun and verb morphemes. Note that Tamil word morphology is exclusive to nouns and verbs.

A few grammar forms were also missing in this dataset such as adjectival participle verbs and certain negated verb forms.

Also Note that Modern Tamil has clearer rules for morphology than Old Tamil. There are also certain morphological differences including but certainly not limited to:
 - The presence of four plural suffixes instead of one
 - The presence of only two tenses (past and non-past)
 - Absence of Sanskrit loan words
 - Changes in negative construction
 - A greater frequency of appellative verbs [2] [3]
 - Despite the differences, modern Tamil still demonstrates a morphological continuity from old Tamil, for example â€“ both have similar noun cases. [2]
 
  See the image below for the conll file provided by the database. Each word was tagged by their part of speech (POS)

## Tamil_Morpheme_List.ipynb
I considered using unsupervised algorithms such as the Morfessor algorithm (combination of minimum description length and maximum a posterior algorithm) or a Nested Pitman-Yor based algorithm for morpheme segmentation to segment the noun and verb morphemes. However, the literature review revealed that using these algorithms for Tamil had an F score of around 50%. Reasons they failed included morphophonemic changes at morpheme boundaries and failing to identify character combinations that needed to be considered as a single character. [4][5] This is why I filtered the dataset for each noun and verb part of speech using regular expressions and manually created a morpheme list.

## Convert_clitics.ipynb 
I identified other parts of speech that were already separated such as postpositions and quantifiers and added them to the clitics list. Then, I gave them each a unique numeric identifier and replaced them in the complete dataframe.

## Convert_lemmas.ipynb/Convert_lemma_with_proper_nouns.ipynb For Convert_lemmas 
For Convert_lemmas -  I identified root words, gave them each a unique numeric identifier and replaced them in the complete dataframe. I converted root words prior to converting morphemes because I did not want to replace morphemes occurring in the root words. I omitted replacing the lemma in proper nouns and instead replaced each letter with their own identifier.

For Convert_lemma_with_proper_nouns - I did the same as above except I replaced the lemma in proper nouns with unique identifiers.

## Convert_morphemes.ipynb/Convert_morphemes_with_proper_nouns For Convert_morphemes 
For Convert_morphemes - I gave unidentified morphemes as well as letters appearing in proper nouns identifiers. I assumed that proper nouns are spelled syllabically in a logosyllabic language. I added this version of the script to the folder Converted_Tamil_With_Syllabic_Names.

For Convert_morphemes_with_proper_nouns - I created a version of the script converting the names into their own signs. This is in the folder Converted_Tamil_With_Logographic_Names. I gave the same identifiers to morphemes that were spelled differently but still had the same phonetic and grammatical function.

## Convert_logosyllabic_words_to_sentences.ipynb/Convert_logosyllabic_words_to_sentences_with_names.ipynb 
I converted the logosyllabic words to sentences using punctuation labels.
